Pre-requisites
-------------------------
- Docker up & running
- ADB 

Install Trimui toolchain
-------------------------
Get the Trimui toolchain at https://git.crowdedwood.com/trimui-toolchain/
Follow the readme installation step

Clone Arnold sources
-------------------------
Get Arnold for Trimui at https://github.com/liartes/arnold_gcw0

Clone libmmenu sources
-------------------------
Get libmmenu at https://github.com/shauninman/libmmenu

Build libmmenu
-------------------------
In the libmmenu source folder, using the Docker toolchain command-line execute
	ToolChainShell> make clean && make

Build Arnold
-------------------------
In the Arnold source folder, using the Docker toolchain command-line execute
	ToolChainShell> make clean && make

BONUS : debug on Trimui with adb + GDB
-------------------------
Using commander app on the Trimui, copy the /etc/init.d/rc.final to the SDCARD
On a computer, add the following line to the file, right before the /etc/init.d/main & line
	/etc/init.d/adbd start & to /etc/init.d/rc.final 

Using commander app again, replace the /etc/init.d/rc.final with the modified rc.final file.

reboot the Trimui device, adb service should be running

Connect the Trimui device to the computer with a USB data cable

Check that adb service is running alright with commande
	HostCommandLine> adb devices
	
if a device shows up, you can get a shell access into the trimui with
	HostCommandLine> adb shell
	
You can copy files directly using your host command line with
	HostCommandLine> adb push /path/to/SOURCE_FILE /path/to/destination/	

Transfer GDB executable on the Trimui using adb
	HostCommandLine> adb push gdb /mnt/SDCARD/Emus/GX4000.pak/

Now, back to the adb shell on the Trimui :
	
GDB need a path variable in order to find the libraries, execute command 
	TrimuiShell> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/trimui/lib"
	
You can start Arnold directly with GDB
	TrimuiShell> ./gdb --args "./arnold" "-cart" "/mnt/SDCARD/Roms/GX4000/ROM_FILE"
	
Or run Arnold on the Trimui, then bind GDB with the PID of the process
	TrimuiShell> ./gdb -p PID
